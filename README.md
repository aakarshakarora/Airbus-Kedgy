# Washing Machine Manufacturing Data Management System

This is a data management system designed to streamline the process of manufacturing washing machines. It provides a
centralized platform for different departments to manage their data related to logistics, supply chain, planning,
execution, and forecasting of orders. The platform is designed to reduce redundancy, improve data authenticity, and make
data management more sustainable in the long term.

## Tech Stack

The platform is built using the following technologies:

- Django - Backend service
- HTML/Bootstrap/Javascript - Frontend
- SqlLite3 - database management system
- Python3 - Scripting

## Features

- `Data lake`: The platform has a normalized database that stores all the data related to the manufacturing process,
  from fabrication to assembly. The database is designed to reduce redundancy and improve data authenticity.

- `Redundant data identification`: The platform can identify redundant data from the forecasted data generated by
  different departments. This helps to reduce data duplication and ensure that only authentic data is used in the
  manufacturing process.

- `Real-time data approval`: The platform has an automation process for data stamping (approval) of the real-time data.
  This ensures that the data is authentic and up-to-date before it is used in the manufacturing process.

## Data Lake

A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured,
semi structured, and unstructured data.

Our data lake is designed to reduce redundancy,improve integrity,data analysis and data security in the system and
ensure data authenticity.

The solution is built using the latest open source technologies, including React for the frontend, Django for the
backend, The platform has authentication and authorization for users based on their department and level of access.
Overall, our data lake solution meets the requirements stated in the problem statement and is fully functional for users
with a focus on sustainability and reducing redundancy in the system.

### How to scale up ?

- Sharding: Sharding involves partitioning a database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards.
- Replication: Replication involves creating multiple copies of the database and distributing them across multiple
- Load Balancing: Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple database servers, helping to evenly
  distribute the workload and prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
  servers.
- Caching: Caching can improve the performance of read-heavy workloads by storing frequently accessed data in a fast
  in-memory cache.
